## Rescue Association
In recent years, numerous environmental crises, including global warming and water scarcity, have significantly impacted human life and the ecosystems of Earth. These crises have led to widespread climate change and forced migrations. To mitigate the harmful effects of such environmental challenges, international conferences are held annually, and organizations are established to implement appropriate policies. However, many believe that these efforts remain insufficient, as environmental crises continue to escalate globally. According to these individuals, the most effective solution lies in fostering global unity to address these issues, a goal that requires raising public awareness on this critical matter.

The "Rescue Association" strives to enhance awareness by simulating the personas of individuals who are actively seeking solutions to save the planet from these crises. By creating an interactive environment between users and these personas, the initiative aims to familiarize society with the challenges of this field and contribute to a deeper understanding of the issues at hand.
